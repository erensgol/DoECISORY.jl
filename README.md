**DoECISORY** is a Julia package and interactive web application for Design of Experiments (DoE), statistical modelling, and multi-objective optimisation. Developed for formulation science and scientific research, it supports cloud deployment, local workstation execution, and integration with the Julia REPL, Pluto.jl, and Jupyter environments.

## Core Capabilities

* **3-Factor Experimental Designs**: Matrices for 3-factor formulation spaces, including Box-Behnken (BB15), Central Composite (CD17), Taguchi (TL09), and Fractional D-Optimal (DF14).
* **Information Optimality Metrics**: Evaluation of D-, A-, G-, and I-efficiencies and design matrix condition numbers.
* **Stoichiometry and Mass Balance**: Automated mass balance audits, excipient balancing, molar ratios, and concentration consistency checks (`Lib_Mole`).
* **Decay Adjustments**: Pre-reaction preparation decay normalisation and post-reaction measurement restoration back to End of Synthesis (EOS) via `VISE_ApplyForwReveDecay_DDEF` and `MOLE_CalcRadioDecay_DDEF`.
* **Multi-Objective Optimisation and DCYP**: Derringer-Suich desirability profiling with continuous and categorical criteria:
  - **Decay-Coupled Yield Penalty (DCYP)**: In-reaction kinetic trade-off arbitration penalising prolonged duration against exponential isotope decay.
  - **Gaussian Neighbour-Weighting Regularisation**: Smoothens multi-objective landscape ridges for stable metaheuristic and grid convergence.
* **Candidate Pool Formulation**: Generates a tiered portfolio of viable formulations rather than a single point:
  - *Absolute Leaders (`TOP-XX`)*: Highest unconstrained composite desirability.
  - *Input Minimisation (`INP-<Factor>`)*: Cost-saving formulations achieving $\ge 90\%$ desirability with minimal reagent consumption or thermal stress.
  - *Output Specialisation (`OUT-<Response>`)*: Solutions prioritising critical quality attributes like purity or specific activity.
* **Sequential Interphase Transfer (ACTA and ASTM)**: Bridges successive experimental phases through:
  - *ACTA (Adaptive Contraction & Translation Algorithm)*: Evaluates relative position ($p_i$) to contract search boundaries ($c$) around the leader or translate them ($\delta$) upon boundary contact.
  - *ASTM (Affine Space Transformation Model)*: Applies affine scaling ($x_{\text{new}} = \alpha \cdot x_{\text{old}} + \beta$) and absolute physical clamping.
* **Statistical Diagnostics**: Seven-stage scientific analysis report featuring OLS linear and quadratic regression, ANOVA, Lack-of-Fit tests, cross-validated $Q^2$ (overfitting protection), and VIF multicollinearity screening.
* **Visualisation**: PlotlyJS 3D response surfaces, equipotential 2D contour maps with fixed-factor slicing, and IPKT interval shift charts (`Lib_Arts`).
* **Spreadsheet Data Exchange (Excel)**: Multi-sheet protocol workbooks (`.xlsx`) with formatting standards, formula preservation, and zero data loss (`Sys_Fast`).

## System Workspaces and Sequential Workflow

DoECISORY separates functional interfaces from sequential experimental phases:

### User Workspaces
* **`Gui_Deck` (Design & Formulation Workspace)**: Stoichiometric mass balance checks (`Lib_Mole`), factor definitions, 3-factor matrix generation (`BB15`, `CD17`, `TL09`, `DF14`), and protocol workbook export (`Sys_Fast`).
* **`Gui_Lens` (Analytics & Decision Workspace)**: Ingestion of completed experimental datasets, automatic decay corrections (precursor forward decay and EOS reverse decay via `VISE_ApplyForwReveDecay_DDEF`), OLS quadratic regression, ANOVA, cross-validated $Q^2$, Lack-of-Fit, DCYP multi-objective optimisation, Candidate Pool inspection, and 7-stage reporting (`Lib_Vise`, `Lib_Arts`).
* **`Sys_Flow` (Interphase Transition Engine)**: Executes IPKT (ACTA boundary contraction/translation + ASTM affine space projection and clamping) to transition between sequential experimental phases.

### Sequential Experimental Workflow
1. **Phase 1 (Screening / Exploration)**: Formulate in `Gui_Deck` $\rightarrow$ execute laboratory runs $\rightarrow$ analyse and generate candidate pool in `Gui_Lens`.
2. **Interphase Knowledge Transfer (IPKT = ACTA + ASTM)**: Select a candidate leader from the pool in `Gui_Lens` $\rightarrow$ apply ACTA contraction/translation ($c$, $\delta$) $\rightarrow$ apply ASTM affine scaling/regeneration ($\alpha \cdot x + \beta$) and clamping via `Sys_Flow`.
3. **Phase 2 (Refinement / Optimisation)**: Automatically load adapted boundaries into `Gui_Deck` $\rightarrow$ generate Phase 2 protocol matrix with prior variance preserved $\rightarrow$ execute and verify in `Gui_Lens`.

## Usage Pathways

DoECISORY supports three distinct execution pathways depending on operational and research requirements:

---

### Pathway 1: Cloud Deployment (Hugging Face Spaces)

DoECISORY is deployed as a containerised service on Hugging Face Spaces, providing access to the complete computational platform and graphical interface without requiring local Julia installation, dependency resolution, or local storage.

Select the access point according to your operational goal:

* **[Launch Web Application](https://erensgol-doecisory.hf.space)** *(Primary Workspace)*  
  Opens the DoECISORY interface directly in your browser without external platform headers.

* **[Hugging Face Space Portal](https://huggingface.co/spaces/erensgol/DoECISORY)** *(Container Management & Wake-up)*  
  Use if the cloud container has entered sleep mode to trigger a wake-up restart.

---

### Pathway 2: Local Repository Deployment

For users working directly with the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erensgol/DoECISORY.jl.git
cd DoECISORY.jl
```

* **Option 2A: Interactive Gateway (`Run_DoE.bat`)**  
  Execute `Run_DoE.bat` in the project root to open the startup menu:
  - **Standard Mode [1]**: Default execution profile. Utilises a precompiled system image (`build/sysimage.dll` or `sysimage.so`) if present, or proceeds with standard JIT compilation.
  - **Developer Mode [2]**: Environment for code modification without restarting the session (via Revise.jl)
  - **Clean JIT Mode [3]**: JIT execution with basic compiler optimisations (`-O1`), bypassing any system image.
  - **Build Sysimage [4]**: Compiles a local system image via `build/Compiler.jl` to eliminate JIT latency.
  - **Run Test Suite [5]**: Executes the automated test suite (100 verifications) directly from the gateway menu.

* **Sysimage Compilation Workflow**  
  Install `PackageCompiler` once in your global Julia environment (`@v#.#`):
  ```bash
  julia -e "using Pkg; Pkg.activate(); Pkg.add(\"PackageCompiler\")"
  ```
  Then build the precompiled sysimage via command-line or `Run_DoE.bat`:
  ```bash
  julia --project=. build/Compiler.jl
  ```
  Once compiled, the application launches with prewarmed Plotly and Dash caches.

* **Option 2B: Command-Line Execution**  
  Launch directly from the terminal with automatic multi-threading:
  ```bash
  julia --threads=auto --project=. app.jl
  ```
  The server outputs operational logs to the terminal and serves the interface locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8060`.

---

### Pathway 3: Julia Package Ecosystem (`Pkg`)

For integration into existing Julia workflows or computational pipelines:

```julia
using Pkg
# Install from GitHub repository:
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/erensgol/DoECISORY.jl")
# Or once published to the General Registry:
# Pkg.add("DoECISORY")

using DoECISORY
```

#### Option 3A: Launching the Web Interface from Julia

* **Interactive Terminal Mode (Synchronous)**  
  Launches the server and streams runtime logs directly to the console:
  ```julia
  run_app(wait=true)
  ```
  *(Press `Ctrl + C` in the console to terminate the server).*

* **Asynchronous Process Mode (Non-blocking)**  
  Spawns the server as an independent child process, keeping the active REPL prompt unblocked:
  ```julia
  run_app()
  ```

#### Option 3B: Headless Algorithmic Execution (Julia REPL, Scripts & Notebooks)

Mathematical, stoichiometric, and statistical routines in DoECISORY can be executed directly without launching the graphical user interface. This enables interactive computational workflows within the **Julia REPL**, standalone `.jl` scripts, **Pluto.jl**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**:

```julia
using DoECISORY

# 1. Generate a 3-factor experimental design matrix (e.g. Box-Behnken, 15 runs)
X_coded = CORE_GenDesign_DDEF("BB15")

# 2. Compute D-, A-, G-, and I-optimality metrics and condition number
metrics = CORE_CalcDesignMetrics_DDEF(Float64.(X_coded), "quadratic")
println("D-Efficiency: ", round(metrics["D"], digits=4))
println("Condition No: ", round(metrics["Condition"], digits=2))

# 3. Fit a quadratic OLS regression model
X = Float64.(X_coded)
Y = [2.5 + 1.2*x[1] - 0.8*x[2] + 0.5*x[3]^2 for x in eachrow(X)]
model = VISE_Regress_DDEF(X, Y, "quadratic"; InNames=["Temp", "Time", "Conc"])
println("R²: ", round(model["R2"], digits=4))

# 4. Predict responses (interactive in REPL, or wrapped in begin...end in Pluto.jl)
begin
    pred = VISE_Predict_DDEF(model, [0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
    println("Predicted Centre Response: ", round(pred[1], digits=2))
end
```

> **Design Space Scope:** DoECISORY is designed for 3-factor experimental and formulation studies. Matrix generators (`BB15`, `CD17`, `TL09`, `DF14`), optimality calculations, and response surface models operate on 3 continuous factors.
